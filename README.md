# Computation of Pi
First Assignment- infinite series calculation of pi
The purpose of this class is to provide a computation of pi
with six significant figure accuracy using an infinite series 
that calculates pi over four. This program will provide the 
number of iterations that it took for the computation of pi, 
the calculated value of pi and the library value of pi for
comparison.
